The Password Reset Flow
    From the login page, the user clicks on the ‘Forgot Password’ link.
    The request hits the /forgotPassword route in the SecurityController
    The forgotPassword.html template (which is in the security directory) is returned to the user. This template has a form with a single email field.
    User enters his email and submits the form.
    This new request arrives via the /passwordRequest route in the PasswordResetController
    The forgottenPassword(email) is invoked with the passed in user’s email
    If and email exists, then a token is generated and send along to the user via a password reset email
    User receives the email and clicks on the link in the email
    The request arrives via the /passwordChange route in the PasswordResetController
    The changePassword() method sends the user the password reset form along with the token. This form contains two fields: newPassword and confirmPassword
    User fills the form and submits via the /passwordChange route
    The updatePassword is called with the password and token and the user data is saved
    The user is redirected to the passwordChangeSuccessful page
